# LWZ-encoding-decoding-algorithms

The Lempel Ziv Welch algorithm is a lossless data compression algorithm. 
LZW is an adaptive compression algorithm that does not assume prior knowledge of the input data distribution. 
This algorithm works well when the input data is sufficiently large and there is redundancy in the data. 
This algorithm has two steps:
1. Compressing: Encoding
2. Decompressing: Decoding

Before running the program, you need to install the tabulate directory.

The implementation of the algorithm is based on the description in the book:
M. F. Mesiya, Contemporary Communication Systems, McGraw-Hill, 2012
